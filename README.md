TeX line breaking algorithm in JavaScript
=========================================

This is an implementation of the <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113445055/abstract">Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm</a> using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element. The goal of this implementation is to optimally set justified text in the new HTML5 canvas element, and ultimately provide a library for various line breaking algorithms in JavaScript.
